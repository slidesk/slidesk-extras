# SliDesk Plugin: Animate

This plugin lets you add a timer to automatically advance to the next slide.

To allow that, you need to add a class on the slide, prefixed with `auto-`.

```
## A slide with no animation

...

## From .[animate]

This is the element will be animated between both slides

## To .[animate]

This is the element will be animated between both slides

And because this element is present, the element below moves

## An another slide with no animation

...

```
