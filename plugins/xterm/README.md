# Plugin `xterm`

Add a `<div class="xterm"></div>` code in your slide to activate this plugin on it.

Since slidesk@2.7.8

Need `unbuffer` command line tool (for example on Mac OS X, you can install it with "brew install expect")

You can specify a start command with `data-cmd` attribute.

```html
<div class="xterm" data-cmd="ls -l">
```
